ActsAsFollowed
===============

Sets up a polymorphic association between different models and users in order to track users who are "following" a certain resource. You can use this to trigger events such as email notifications, etc. So, if a user is following a Project, or a Conversation, you can create an observer that sends emails based on followships during the lifecycle (create, update, whatever) of the resource.

# set up this table
class CreateTableFollowships < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table "followships", :force => true do |t|
      t.integer  "followed_id"
      t.string   "followed_type"
      t.integer  "follower_id"  # set up to take a User object in the association
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :followships
  end
end



Example
=======

class Author
  acts_as_followed
end

author = Author.new
author.followships => [] # all of the followships for this author


Add this code to the User class (or change the data migration to have a different field than user_id)
class User
  acts_as_follower
end

Given a Follower and a Celebrity (whichever classes you like)
follower = User.first
celebrity = Celebrity.first

Methods 

following?
  follower.following?(celebrity) => true

followships
  follower.followships => [] # all followships across resources
  follower.followships.for(celebrity) => followship for the particular resource
